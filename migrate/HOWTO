A (very) rough guide to migration of messages from ZODB to RDB
--------------------------------------------------------------

1) place migration_scripts in ListManager folder

2) run migration_scripts/update_site_id to make sure all lists have siteIds

3) switch on RDB message storage using migration_scripts/switch_on_rdb

4) generate a list of group IDs and their message counts for migration using
   migration_scripts/generate_group_ids, and save this to a file.

5) create a folder on the filesystem called (say) exported_email, and run this command,
   substituting the upper case variables to match your site:
   
     $ grep -v " 0" IDS_FILE | cut -f1 -d" " | \
         xargs -n1 --replace={} wget -O{}.mbox \
         http://ZOPEHOST:ZOPEPORT/sites/SITEID/ListManager/{}/export_as_mbox
     
   At this stage you should now have all your exported email on the filesystem, in mbox format.
   The processing script requires that this email be in maildir format (or at least, one email
   per file). My suggestion at this stage is to concatenate all the mbox files and run mb2md
   on them (on ubuntu you can do apt-get install mb2md) to create a maildir folder.

6) edit the import_emailmessages.py script in this directory to match your settings
   for your postgresql install

7) run the import script:
    $ export PYTHONPATH=.
    $ export SOFTWARE_HOME=/path/to/zope-install/lib/python
    $ export INSTANCE_HOME=/path/to/zope-instance
    $ DRY_RUN=0 \
      IMPORT_DIR=/path/to/maildir/cur \
      LOG_FILE=somelogfile.log
      START_POS=0
      PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
      BUILDOUT/bin/python import_emailmessages.py

8) have many, many coffees (if you have a lot of messages). It will take a while. You may want to 
   temporarily turn off fsync in postgresql, this will make the initial import a lot faster (at
   the expense of data safety ... don't forget to turn it back on!).
   
9) Check your error log file. You may have lots of duplicate messages, this is
   kinda normal, but you should *not* have any BODY DIFF sections ... that would be
   a symptom of an md5 clash. If you have an example of that, please email me.

10) run the generate_fileids script. This will generate a list for the file metadata import script
    to use.
    
    $  ZOPE_PYTHON_INSTALL/bin/python generate_fileids.py /path/to/maildir/cur/ > post_topic_fileids.csv

    Annoyingly, you will need to remove the first two lines of cruft from the file.
    
11) run migration_scripts/generate_file_metadata, and save the output to a file

12) tweak the settings in import_filemetadata.py for your local database, then run:

    $ ZOPE_PYTHON_INSTALL/bin/python -u import_filemetadata.py \
        file_metadata.csv post_topic_fileids.csv 
        
And hopefully you're done!
